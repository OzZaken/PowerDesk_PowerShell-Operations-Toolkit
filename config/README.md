# File Example
Within the "config" folder, you will find the following text files:

- HOSTS.txt: This file contains a list of hostnames or IP addresses associated with workstations within the domain.
- PORTS.txt: This file contains a list of specific ports that are of interest for network connectivity testing or monitoring purposes.

By storing this information in text files, it becomes easier to update or modify the list of hosts and ports without modifying the actual scripts or tools that utilize this data.

Please note that the "Work Station (WS)" folder primarily serves as a data storage location and does not contain executable scripts or tools. Its purpose is to provide a centralized location for managing and accessing host and port information.
